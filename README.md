- Movie Recommendation System

This project uses KNN to recommend movies to users based on the movie they liked. Using their descriptions, we made a vector corresponding to each movie. The cosine similarity between the movie vectors were calculated to find the one closest to the one user liked.

- Stock Price Predictor

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for both classification and regression to predict future stock price movements and actual closing prices based on historical data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It evaluates the models using accuracy for classification and RMSE for regression, optimizing performance through GridSearchCV.
